            <p class="i">Sports is an integral part in the development of an individual and the world is filled with sports enthusiasits and players<br> alike
                who share a common love of either playing or watching some form of a sport.<br> There are multiple types of sports and various games 
                come under the category of being a sport.<br> Be it outdoor or indoor, regardless of the type all games are challenging and require
                the utmost of efforts.

               Sports instil the idea of magnanimosity and discipline in an individual.<br>Acumen and Talent
                to play any sport is an unbiased trait and is directly correalted to the perseverance,hard work and spirit of an
                rather than their race,religion,gender or any other discriminative derogative.<br>

                   As a sports enthusiasit myself, its an honour to prepare a blog in the name ogf sports<br>
                   The exhileration, the excitment felt during a single match of any game provides a huge and perhaps 
                   unhealty boost in adrenaline of an individual, those who're actually playing and even those watching.
                   This is why sports is a universal link between people.

                   Due to the extravangant and popular nature of sports almost all games have competitions to find the best gamer
                   and according to the popularity a prize is decided.<br>
                Various Events like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games are oppurtunities for athletes to represent their respective
                nation and make their home country proud.<br>
                Such is the power of sports.
